With **go-cpulimit** you can limit the CPU usage of your go program. It provides a function called `Wait()` that holds
your program, until the CPU usage is below max CPU usage.

You should use this `Wait()` function in as many situations as possible, e.g. on every iteration in a `for loop`.

**Warning:** This limiter does not work, if there are insufficient `Wait()` calls.

## Example

```golang
limiter := &cpulimit.Limiter{
MaxCPUUsage:     50.0, // throttle CPU usage to 50%
MeasureInterval: time.Millisecond * 333, // measure cpu usage in an interval of 333 ms
Measurements:    3, // use the avg of the last 3 measurements
}
limiter.Start()
defer limiter.Stop()
for {
limiter.Wait() // wait until cpu usage is below 50%
/*
 * do some work
 */
}
```
